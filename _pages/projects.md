## Personal Project  
### Intentionality (Budgeting Website)  
•	I love money and managing it, so I translated the system that I have been using in my head into a website that can help adults who struggle with financial literacy.  
•	Applied skills in SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS to create a simple, navigable website that utilizes a database that stores each user’s username, hashed password, the percentage of their income they want allocated to different categories, and the balances of these categories.  

## Academic Projects  
### Local Language Model Text Response  
https://github.com/1ntentions/Local-Language-Model-Text-Response  
•	Applied skills in Python and Conda to install two local language models that each read multiple prompts from a text file before responding to them and saving those responses to another text file.  
### Mission Demolition (Game)  
https://github.com/1ntentions/Mission-Demolition  
•	Applied skills in C# and ShaderLab to add unique functionalities such as a game over screen, restart button, more levels, a slingshot band, audio, and a chance of a faster projectile to a pre-existing tutorial from the “Intro to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development” textbook.  
### Apple Picker (Game)  
https://github.com/1ntentions/Apple-Picker  
•	Applied skills in C# and ShaderLab to add unique functionalities such as a start screen with a start button, an extra basket to catch apples, UI to tell the player what round they are in, a game over screen, and a branch that the player should avoid catching to a pre-existing tutorial from the “Intro to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development” textbook.

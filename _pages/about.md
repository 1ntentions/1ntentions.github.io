Hi, I am Ian Dunn. I am an undergraduate computer science student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville who is interested in data science and software engineering. I love the field of computer science because it coincides with how I live my dull life like a program. I constantly update different functions in my head so I can accept various arguments that can handle any situation I encounter.

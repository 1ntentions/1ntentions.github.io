Hi, I am Ian Dunn. I am an undergraduate computer science student at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville who is interested in data engineering and software engineering. I love the field of computer science because it coincides with how I live my deterministic life like a program. As I constantly learn new things I update different functions in my head so I can accept various arguments and handle different situations that I encounter.
